I’d like to talk about a time when my close friend, Khanh Tien, asked for my opinion on her plan to study abroad. We’ve been friends since high school, and this happened last year when she was considering an undergraduate program in Australia.

Khanh Tien wanted my opinion because she trusted me and knew I had researched international education. She was torn about whether to study in Australia or stay in Vietnam, as going abroad meant high costs and leaving her family behind. She valued my perspective to help her make this big decision.

I advised her to pursue the Australian program. I explained that studying abroad would give her global exposure, better career opportunities, and a chance to experience a new culture. I also recommended applying for scholarships to manage costs and staying connected with her family through video calls.

When Khanh Tien inquire for my opinion, I felt honored and valued, as it showed her trust in me. I was excited to guide her through her decision, which brought us closer as friends. Her appreciation for my advice afterwards made me feel incredibly fulfilled



1. Should teachers give advice to children? I think teachers should provide guidance to children, as it supports their development beyond academics. By offering advice on moral values, like honesty or respect, teachers help students grow into responsible individuals. For example, they can guide students on resolving conflicts or making good choices. However, teachers must stay within professional limits, ensuring advice is appropriate and doesn’t replace parental roles or push personal beliefs.
    
2. What are the disadvantages of sharing opinions on the Internet? Sharing opinions online can lead to misinformation, as people may post unverified or false information, causing confusion or harm. Another disadvantage is cyberbullying, where individuals face aggressive or hurtful responses to their views. This can create a toxic environment, discouraging open discussion and affecting mental well-being.

I’d like to talk about an unforgettable sunset I saw on Danang Beach, a small beach on the Son Tra Peninsula in Vietnam’s coastal city of Danang. This happened last summer, around 6 p.m. in the evening.

What I saw was a stunning sunset with vibrant colors—oranges, pinks, and purples blending beautifully in the sky. The reflection of these colors on the sea was mesmerizing, and a few clouds added a lovely evening effect, making the scene even more dramatic.

I stood on the beach, completely captivated, watching the sunset for about 15 minutes. During that time, I noticed how the colors changed and slowly faded as the sun disappeared below the horizon.

I felt peaceful and amazed by the experience. The beauty of the sunset was like a natural wonder, making me feel grateful for such a magical moment. It brought a sense of calm and reminded me to appreciate life’s simple joys. Watching it on the quiet beach made it even more special.

What it is: My natural talent is hyperfocus, a skill where I can intensely concentrate on something that captures my interest, often for long periods, which I believe stems from living with ADHD.

When you discovered it: I first noticed this ability during a coding project in high school, where I lost track of time while solving complex problems, realizing it gave me an edge in tasks I enjoyed.

How you want to improve it: I’d like to harness it more effectively by setting clear goals for each session, using techniques like Pomodoro to balance focus with breaks, and applying it to areas like studying or creative projects beyond just coding.

And how you feel about it: I feel excited about this talent because it’s a unique strength, though sometimes it can be challenging to manage—overall, I’m motivated to refine it to boost my productivity and enjoyment.

# Natural talent (Speaking part 2)

**What it is:** My natural talent is hyperfocus, a skill I’ve come to recognize as a unique strength linked to living with ADHD. Essentially, it’s this amazing ability to dive deeply into something that really grabs my attention, blocking out distractions and focusing intensely for hours. For me, this often happens with activities like coding, gaming, or even solving puzzles. It’s not something everyone experiences, and I think it’s a special gift that comes with my ADHD (symptom/ diagnose), though it can be a double-edged sword at times.

**When you discovered it:** My first discovered this talent back in high school during a coding project. I remember sitting at my desk, working on this tricky program, and suddenly realizing that hours had flown by without me even noticing. My mom almost hit me because she called me for a long time because I didn't reply to her. However, I’d accomplished a lot, and that’s when it clicked—this intense focus was something I could do naturally when I was passionate about the task. It was a eureka moment for me, and since then, I’ve noticed it popping up in other areas too, like when I get lost in a good book or a creative hobby.

**How you want to improve it:** I’d love to improve this talent by making it more controllable and productive. Right now, it kicks in randomly, so I want to learn how to direct it better. For example, I’m thinking of using techniques like the Pomodoro method—working in focused bursts with short breaks—to channel my hyperfocus into studying or work projects. I also want to expand it to new areas, like learning a musical instrument or improving my writing skills, by finding ways to make those tasks engaging enough to trigger that deep focus. With practice, I hope to turn it into a superpower for achieving my goals.

**And how you feel about it:** (I feel really excited and proud of this talent because it sets me apart and helps me excel when I’m in the zone. At the same time, it can be a bit frustrating when I can’t switch it off or when it doesn’t align with what I need to do, like everyday chores. Overall, though, )I’m motivated to work on it because I see its potential to boost my productivity and bring more joy to my life. It’s like having a hidden tool that I’m still learning for the entry undergraduate's test, and that journey feels both challenging and rewarding.

The debate over whether a university degree or skills experience are more important for securing a good job reflect differing perspectives on career success.
On the one hand, proponents of a university degree argue that it provides a strong foundation of knowledge and credentials that employers value. A degree often open doors to professional opportunities, especially in fields like medicine, law, or engineering, where formal qualifications are essential. It also signals commitment and intellectual ability, giving graduates an edge in competitive job markets. For instance, many high-paying roles list a degrees as a minimum requirement, suggesting it remains a key factor in career advancement.
Although, that in today's dynamic, ever-changing workplace, practical knowledge and experience are more important. Skills learned through apprenticeships, vocational study or independent learning in the form of technical knowledge or problem-solving, perhaps are directly comparable with workplace needs. Also, experiential learning demonstrates practical competency, something many employers, especially in fields as tech or skilled trade, tend to value over general degrees, as many with documented histories of accomplishment or specialized skill ten d to find work without degrees, thus highlighting practical knowledge.
In conclusion, while skills and experience are valuable, a university degree stands out as the best way to secure a good job. Its role in providing comprehensive education, enhancing employability, and ensuring long-term career growth makes it a superior choice in most professional fields.

**Who your friend is:** My friend was Long, who used to be my best friend during our secondary school years. We were inseparable back then, sharing everything from school projects to late-night chats. Long was always cheerful and supportive, which made him someone I trusted deeply. Even though we’ve drifted apart since graduating, he still holds a special place in my memories.

**What the truth was:** One day, I decided to tell Long the truth about something I’d been hiding for months—I was struggling with depression because of the overwhelming pressure from secondary school, family expectations, and my own uncertainties about the future. I explained how I felt constantly exhausted, anxious, and even hopeless at times, but I hadn’t shared it with anyone until then. It was a tough confession, but I felt he deserved to know why I’d been so distant lately.

**What your friend’s reaction was:** At first, Long was shocked and didn’t know what to say. He just stared at me for a moment, which made me nervous. Then, he hugged me and said he was sorry for not noticing how much I was suffering. He asked if I’d seen a doctor or talked to my family, showing genuine concern. Later, he encouraged me to seek help, though he admitted he didn’t fully understand what I was going through. Our friendship started to change after that, and we gradually grew apart, maybe because he found it hard to handle my struggles.

**And explain why you think it was important to tell your friend the truth:** I think it was important to tell Long the truth because keeping it inside was eating me up, and I needed someone to share my burden with. He was my closest friend, and I believed he could support me or at least understand me better. Sharing that truth also pushed me to face my problems and eventually seek professional help, which changed my life for the better. Even though it affected our friendship, I feel it was a necessary step to be honest with myself and him, helping me start my journey toward healing.

Do you think we should tell the truth at all times?
	Not always. Telling the truth is important for trust and honesty, but there are situations where it might hurt someone unnecessarily or cause harm, like sparing someone’s feelings in a sensitive moment. A balance is key—truth should be shared with kindness and consideration, especially in personal relationships.

How do you know when others are telling lies?
	You can often tell by inconsistencies in their story, avoiding eye contact, or nervous body language like fidgeting. Changes in tone or hesitation can also be clues. However, it’s not foolproof—some people are good at hiding lies, so it’s best to trust your instincts and look for patterns over time.

**Where you were:** I remember that time I was on Son Tra Peninsula, a beautiful but vast area near Da Nang, known for its lush forests and stunning coastal views. I had decided to travel there alone last midsummer to enjoy some peace and nature, something I don’t often do because of my social anxiety, which makes crowded places or asking for help really tough for me.

**What happened:** One afternoon, I wandered off the main trail while exploring, trying to find a quieter spot to relax. I didn’t have a detailed map or strong signal on my phone, and before I knew it, I realized I’d lost the path. The dense trees and winding roads made everything look the same, and my anxiety kicked in as I panicked about being stuck or needing to ask strangers for directions, which I dreaded.

**How you felt:** I felt a mix of fear and frustration. My heart was racing, and the silence of the forest, combined with my worry about getting lost, made my social anxiety flare up. I was scared of running into people I’d have to talk to, but at the same time, I felt lonely and helpless, unsure how to get back.

**And explain how you found your way:** After taking a few deep breaths to calm down, I decided to retrace my steps slowly, looking for familiar landmarks like a big rock I’d passed earlier. I also used my phone’s compass, which thankfully worked despite the weak signal, to head back toward the coast where I knew the main road was. Eventually, I heard some distant voices and carefully followed them, staying on the edge of the path until I saw a signpost. It leda me back to the tourist area, and I felt a huge relief once I was safe again.

**Why do some people get lost more easily than others?** Some people get lost more easily due to differences in spatial awareness or navigation skills, which can be influenced by genetics or experience. Others might struggle because of distractions, poor memory, or conditions like anxiety, which can cloud judgment. Confidence and familiarity with an area also play a role—those less experienced tend to lose their way more often.

**Do you think it is important to be able to read a map?** Yes, it’s extremely necessary, especially in areas with no signal or unreliable technology. Reading a map builds independence and helps in emergencies when GPS fails. However, with modern tools, it’s less critical for some, though the skill still boosts confidence and problem-solving.

**Do you think it is important to do some preparation before you travel to new places?** Absolutely. Preparation, like researching the destination, checking maps, or learning basic phrases, reduces stress and prevents getting lost. It also ensures safety and makes the trip more enjoyable, especially for someone with social anxiety who might avoid asking for help.

**How can people find their way when they are lost?** People can retrace their steps, use landmarks, or rely on a compass or phone app if available. Listening for sounds like traffic or asking for directions—though challenging for some—can help. Staying calm and thinking logically is key to figuring out the way back.

**What it is:** The wild animal I want to learn more about is the beaver, scientifically known as Castor Canadensis. It’s a large rodent famous for its impressive dam-building skills and distinctive flat tail. I find it fascinating because of its unique role in shaping ecosystems, which makes it stand out among other wildlife.

**When/where you saw it:** I first saw a beaver in a nature documentary on National Geography's channel a few months ago, around midsummer this year. The footage was from a wetland area in Canada, showing it working on a dam, and I was amazed by its engineering skills. I haven’t seen one in person yet, but that sighting really piqued my interest.

**Why you want to learn more about it:** I want to learn more because beavers play such an important role in the environment, creating habitats for other species with their dams. I’m curious about how they manage to do this and what challenges they face today, like habitat loss, since I care about nature and its balance.

**And explain what you want to learn more about it:** I’d be curious to delve deeper into learn about its construction techniques, how it chooses materials and builds those strong dams. I’m also interested in its behavior, like how it communicates with family members or survives harsh winters. Additionally, I want to know more about conservation efforts to protect beavers and how I could contribute, perhaps by supporting local wildlife projects.

**When/where you went:** The long journey I'm thinking of was my first trip to Cù Lao Chàm, a beautiful island archipelago off the coast of Quang Nam province in Vietnam. It happened during the summer of 2021, right in the middle of July when the weather was perfect for beach activities. We traveled from Da Nang by bus to the port and then took a ferry across the sea, which made the whole trip feel adventurous and lengthy, lasting about 4-5 hours in total.

**Who you had the journey with:** I went with my extended family, which included my own family and four other families we’re close with—sort of like a big group of relatives and friends treating it as a shared vacation. There were around 20 of us, from kids to parents, so it was lively and full of chatter the whole way.

**Why you had the journey:** We organized the journey as a summer getaway to escape the city heat and bond as a group. It was a chance to relax after a tough year, explore nature, and try new things like island hopping. For me, it was exciting because I’d never been to such a remote spot before, and the idea of staying overnight on the island added to the thrill.

**And explain why you would like to have it again:** I’d love to take this journey again because it was such a memorable experience that left a lasting impression. We stayed at a cozy hotel right near the beach, and I was blown away by the stunning sunsets and sunrises—the sky turning vibrant oranges and pinks over the ocean was like a painting come to life. Plus, I got to try scuba diving for the first time, discovering colorful coral reefs and marine life underwater, which was exhilarating and opened my eyes to a whole new world. Being with the big family group made it even better, with shared meals, laughter, and stories around the bonfire. It was a perfect blend of adventure and relaxation, and I’d relive it to recapture that sense of wonder and connection, especially now that life feels busier.

**What it is:** The important old thing my family has kept is a carved marble relief plaque depicting a Buddhist, symbolizing compassion and enlightenment. It's handcrafted with intricate details like a serene pose and lotus motifs, and we display it on our home altar as a decorative and spiritual item, handling it carefully to preserve it.

**How/when your family first got this thing:** My family first got this relief plaque three years ago, in 2022, during a meaningful visit to Chùa Linh Ứng, one of the most sacred temples in Da Nang. It was just the three of us—my mom, my sibling, and me—on a spontaneous day trip to explore the temple's stunning architecture and peaceful grounds. We bought it from a small shop near the temple entrance after spending time praying and admiring the giant Lady Buddha statue. My mom chose it because she felt drawn to its calming aura, and it became a special souvenir from that family adventure.

**How long your family has kept it:** We've kept it for exactly three years now, since that trip in 2022. As of today, in 2025, it's still in excellent shape, and we often dust it gently to maintain its beauty.

**And explain why this thing is important to your family:** It's important because it represents spiritual protection and inner peace in our busy city life, reminding us of that bonding trip with quiet reflection and unity. It connects us to Buddhist values like kindness and mindfulness, plus our cultural heritage, and we light incense near it for inspiration. Overall, it's a symbol of love, faith, and cherished family memories.
________________________________________________________________________
**What kind of old things do people in your country like to keep?** In Vietnam, people often keep sentimental items like family heirlooms, such as antique jewelry, traditional áo dài clothing, or old photos from the war eras. Religious artifacts, like Buddha statues or incense burners, are common too, especially in rural areas. Many also hold onto vintage items like bicycles from the 1970s or colonial-era furniture, as they represent personal history and cultural pride.

**Why do people keep old things?** People keep old things for emotional reasons, like nostalgia and connection to their past or loved ones. They can also have practical value, such as durability—old craftsmanship often lasts longer than modern mass-produced items. Additionally, some keep them for financial reasons, as antiques can appreciate in value, or for educational purposes, to pass down stories and traditions to younger generations.

**What are the differences between the things old people keep and those young people keep?** Older people in Vietnam tend to keep practical or historical items, like farming tools, war memorabilia, or family recipes in handwritten notebooks, valuing them for their utility and ties to tradition. Younger people, however, often keep tech-related or pop culture items, such as old smartphones, vinyl records, or K-pop merchandise, seeing them as trendy collectibles or reminders of their youth. The focus for elders is on heritage, while for youth, it's more about personal hobbies and nostalgia from recent trends.

**What are the differences between the things that people keep today and the things that people kept in the past?** In the past, people kept essentials like handmade tools, clothing, or documents for survival and daily life, often due to scarcity during times like the wars or economic hardships. Today, with consumerism on the rise, people keep more luxury or digital items, such as gadgets, souvenirs from travels, or eco-friendly heirlooms. Past keepsakes were about necessity and endurance, while modern ones emphasize sentiment, status, or environmental consciousness, influenced by globalization and technology.

**What can we see in a museum?** In a museum, you can see artifacts like ancient pottery, historical weapons, traditional costumes, and artworks that showcase a culture's evolution. In Vietnamese museums, for example, exhibits might include Cham sculptures, French colonial relics, or Vietnam War memorabilia. There are also interactive displays, fossils, or even modern installations on science and technology, depending on the museum's theme.

**What can we learn from a museum?** From a museum, we can learn about history, culture, and human achievements, gaining insights into past societies and how they shaped the present. It fosters empathy by showing diverse perspectives, like the impacts of wars or migrations, and inspires innovation by highlighting inventions. Personally, it encourages critical thinking and appreciation for heritage, helping us avoid repeating mistakes and value diversity in today's world.

## Describe a person

One of my closest friends who is exceptionally good at music and singing is Long, whom I've known since our secondary school days. We first met in class when we were about 13, bonding over shared interests, but it was his passion for music that really drew us closer. Long is tall and lanky with messy black hair and a perpetual grin, always carrying a notebook for jotting down lyrics or melodies that pop into his head.

What makes Long stand out is his incredible talent for singing—he has this smooth, velvety voice that's both powerful and emotional, able to switch from soft ballads to upbeat tunes effortlessly. He's self-taught, starting with humming songs from Vietnamese folk artists like Trịnh Công Sơn, and later branching into international pop like Ed Sheeran or Adele. He especially loves international songs, drawing inspiration from their diverse styles and lyrics. The first song I heard him perform was "Lemon Tree" by Fool's Garden during a school break—he sang it so captivatingly with his guitar, hitting every note perfectly, that I couldn't resist joining in and singing along with him. That spontaneous duet was the spark that made us best friends from then on.

He loves singing because it's his way of expressing feelings he can't always put into words; he once told me that belting out a song after a tough day feels like releasing all the built-up stress, almost like therapy. Back in school, he'd perform at talent shows or assemblies, captivating the audience with covers or his originals about friendship and dreams, and his voice even won him a local singing contest in Da Nang a few years ago.

I remember one time during a school trip, he organized an impromptu karaoke session around a campfire, and his rendition of a heartfelt ballad had everyone mesmerized—it's moments like that where his love for singing shines through, turning ordinary gatherings into memorable experiences. Even now, as adults, we still hang out and jam; he'll grab his guitar, and we'll create silly songs together, which always lifts my mood. Long's dedication to music inspires me, and I think his talent comes from genuine passion rather than formal training—it's why he's so good at it and why our friendship has lasted all these years.
